An AsciiDoc extension, which will simplify the way in which .adoc files can be created. It will offer variables, collections, improved syntax for tables, editable content (add rows/columns to tables, edit content of all elements).

## Introduction:

After working with Asciidoc for years and creating hundreds of Asciidoc files by using different Asciidoc editors and also self-implemented tools, I want to share my improvements on Asciidoc and also an user-friendly, web-based editor, which enables additional features for Asciidoc. This project will run under the name `A*sciidoc`, since it improves the already given Asciidoc language.

## Tools:

A*sciidoc will consist of different products. There will be a simple transpiler, which translates A*sciidoc into classical Asciidoc, so it can be used in all environments, which do support Asciidoc. It will also offer features to directly render A*sciidoc into the browser by using a renderer based on Asciidoctor.

### A*sciidoc Transpiler:

foo

### Web Renderer:

bar

### Code-Editor:

baz

### Adoc Editor:

foobar

## Documentation:
